# Eye-exercise

> Versi√≥n Beta 0.0.1

This is an exercise in which I simulate the look of a man. For this I use the onmousemove event.

### Instalation
Just download the files and open index.html file in Web browser.

### Usage
Move the cursor mouse across the screen.

### Roadmap
1. Add blinking eyes.
2. Place a duck on the cursor
3. Add a laser to the eyes that are always pointed at the duck.
